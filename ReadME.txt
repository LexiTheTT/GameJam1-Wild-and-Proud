Hello eatablekolos! This is some notes and goals for us, Do some if ya like!
0.) Read This.
1.) Fix marker to be placed by cursor.
    a.) Kale needs to fallow the maker then her state switches to idle. If the maker has moved (via signal), Kale's state will change to move.
2.) Impliment fake gravity for a 2.5 platformer.
    a.) I have an idea where we use two boxes, one is the 'Floor' hit box and one is the body hitbox.
    b.) If 'Floor' is touching the ground while touching the body. The body must be on the ground right? 
    ... If the body is not touching 'Floor', it's must be jumping (done by a click). Finishing the jump If the body lands (colides with phyiscis layer 1[top]) and it doesn't match 
    Y level of the 'Floor'. It must be a new Y level, make that the new floor. 
    c.) Not sure how to do this but if jumping up and both the 'Floor' and the 'Player' are touching a wall, the player shouldn't be able to move. 
    If one is touching a wall and the other not. Allow for movement through and let the 'Player' colide with the new 'Floor'
3.) Basic Diologe thing. So that Kale can talk when there is events.
4.) Animation events for interactions.
    a.) If something interactable is clicked on, play animation state/display Diologe.
5.) Make interactable things.
6.) Flesh out the story bits as we go. 



Comunication notes:

This is so hype. -L

Story ideas so far:
    Kale is drifting in the void when an idea-paper smacks her in the face.
    This paper is part of the former NightTime City.
    The paper directs her to the ruins of NTC and she and the paper are gonna rebuild it however...
    parts of the city that have shatered and scattered causing other idea-papers to become convoluted to collect. (Puzzles)
    Kale needs to rebuild NightTime City as NeoNight City.


#Feel free to add bits as you think of them
